    <p>
      So to me, homemade shepherds pie is technically a casserole rather than a
      pie but that’s beside the point. Now, this is technically a cottage pie
      rather than a shepherd's pie since we're using beef here. Should you want
      it traditional you'll just use ground lamb in place of the beef.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Mashed Potato Method:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the mashed potato toppings, rinse and peel the russet potatoes and
        cut lengthwise then lengthwise again and then into quarters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dump all potatoes into a medium pot and cover with water. Season
        generously with salt to taste. Set over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil and let boil for 7-10 minutes. Potatoes should be easily
        pierced with a fork. Drain once finished.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small sauce pot, add in unsalted butter and whole milk. Set on the
        stove over medium heat just until the butter is melted and mixture is
        hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rice/mash all the potatoes using a potato ricer or potato masher. Add in
        the hot butter/milk mixture and mix together before adding and stirring
        in creme fraiche.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate in gruyere cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix
        together until thoroughly combined.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Filling Method:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If not using store bought ground beef, start by slicing the beef (or
        lamb) and thoroughly mix with roughly chopped bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a stand mixer fitted with a meat grinder attachment, grind the beef
        and bacon mixture. Once finished, knead into a firm dough like ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a medium size pot (or pan) over medium-high heat until smoking hot.
        No oil included.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the beef, pressing it in and sear for 3 minutes. Flip and repeat
        on the other side.
      </li>
      <li>
        When both sides are seared. Mash the beef until fine, season with salt
        and pepper, and continue cooking over medium heat in its own fat until
        evenly brown.
      </li>
      <li>Dump out all the beef into a separate bowl and place to the side.</li>
      <li>Add butter to the pot (or pan) and melt over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Once bubbling, add in diced mushrooms and sear until just brown before
        adding in the diced onions, diced celery, diced carrots, and sliced
        garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper. Saute for 2-3 minutes mixing
        occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        When softened, toss in tomato paste sauteing for 2 minutes or until
        caramelized. Deglaze with red wine, stock, or vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow with worcestershire sauce and bring to a boil. Add in fresh
        chopped thyme, fresh chopped rosemary, mix to combine and let reduce
        until all the liquid is gone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in beef stock seasoning to taste with salt and pepper. Mix and let
        cook for 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the frozen peas and stir together. Let cook until the peas are
        nice and hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dump the meat and vegetable mixture into a casserole dish spreading out
        evenly to the edges of the pan. Press the meat down so it’s nice and
        compact.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently add the mashed potatoes on top and evenly spread across the
        surface of the casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grate on some Parmigiano Reggiano and gruyere cheese. Optionally fork
        the top of the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place into a 375F preheated oven for 20 minutes. Let sit for 20 minutes
        before serving.
      </li>
